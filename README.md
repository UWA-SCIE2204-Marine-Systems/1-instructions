Only use this guide [4-how-to-install-R](https://github.com/UWA-SCIE2204-Marine-Systems/1-instructions/blob/master/4-how-to-install-R-on-your-local-computer.md) if ecocloud is not working


The first practical is on [Catch curve analysis](https://github.com/UWA-SCIE2204-Marine-Systems/Catch-curve/blob/master/CatchCurveMarkdown.md)

The second and third practicals are being combined. Both need to be completed the week of the 20th of April:
First complete the practical on [Marine reserves](https://github.com/UWA-SCIE2204-Marine-Systems/No-take-marine-reserves/blob/master/lobster-density-inside-vs-outside-ntmr.md)

At the end of the Marine Reserves practical there is a link to the practical on [Biological Oceanographic in Fisheries ](https://github.com/UWA-SCIE2204-Marine-Systems/Biological-oceanography/blob/master/Puerulus-settlement.md) Complete this also.
