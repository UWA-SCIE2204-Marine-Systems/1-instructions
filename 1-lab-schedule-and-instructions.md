Matt Navarro and Tim Langlois
26/03/2020

## Introduction

We are running two computer labs that can be run from home or in person. 

Your main instructor will be Matt Navarro <matthew.navarro@uwa.edu.au>
with assitance from Tim Langlois.

We will be using R via the
[ecocloud.org.au](https://app.ecocloud.org.au/) RStudio service, in the
cloud.

You should all be able to complete these practicals with an internet
connection from either home, using any web-based device (e.g. a tablet
or laptop), or university using any available computer. If you are
having issues accessing a computer please contact Matt.

Tim thinks you should be able to complete this entire practical on your
smart phone using the Chrome browser - but we recommend a tablet with a
keyboard or computer.

Even if you chose to complete the lab in your own time you can ask
questions and get help by starting a thread in the LMS Discussion Board.
Please post on the unit Discusion Board.

## Assessments

The assesment for each labs will consist of short multi-choice
quizzes. They should only take 5 minutes and you
should complete them **immediately** after you have completed the lab\!
The quizzes will be on LMS.

The quiz deadlines are as follows:

Lab 1 assessment: Due 12pm 9th April

lab 2 assessment: TBD
