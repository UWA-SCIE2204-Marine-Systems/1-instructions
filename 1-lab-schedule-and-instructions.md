## Introduction

We are running the computer lab virtually for SCIE2204.

Your main instructor will be Matt Navarro <matthew.navarro@uwa.edu.au>

We will be using R and you should all be able to complete these
practicals from either home, using any web-based device (e.g. a tablet
or laptop) or using a university computer. If you are having issues
accessing a computer please contact Matt.

For each lab we will have an online video chat using Zoom during the
scheduled lab times.

To install and learn how to use Zoom - go to
[Zoom\_instructions](https://github.com/UWA-SCIE2204-Marine-Systems/1-instructions/blob/master/2-zoom-instructions.md)

The lab schedule is as follows:

  - Lab 1 (Catch curve) Stream A: 31st March 9-11

  - Lab 1 (Catch curve) Stream B: 1st April 9-11

  - Lab 1 (Catch curve) Stream C: 3rd April 14-16

  - Lab 2 (Marine reserves) Stream A: 7th April 9-11

  - Lab 2 (Marine reserves) Stream B: 8th April 9-11

  - Lab 2 (Marine reserves) Stream C: 9th April 8-10 \*\*\*\*\*\*Note
    that this lab was rescheduled to avoid clash with Good Friday\!\!\!

  - Lab 3 (Oceanography) Stream c: 21st April 9-11

  - Lab 3 (Oceanography) Stream B: 22nd April 9-11

  - Lab 3 (Oceanography) Stream C: 24th April 14-16

You have two options for completing the labs:

1.  You can log in to the video chat at **YOUR** scheduled lab time.
    **DO NOT SWAP LAB TIMES\!\!\!** If you really need to switch email
    me: <matthew.navarro@uwa.edu.au>

OR

2.  You can complete each lab in your own time **AFTER** 4pm. **BUT**,
    do not leave it all to the end, as you will miss the assessment
    deadlines\!

Why 4pm? We are running the labs by remotely accessing computers in the
Eastern states (we are cloud computing), and we do not want to overload
them. By 4pm everyone in the East has finished work leaving more room
for us.

Even if you chose te complete the lab in your own time you can ask
questions and get help by starting a thread in the LMS Discussion Board.
Please post on the unit Discusion Board under [“Computer
practicals”](https://lms.uwa.edu.au/webapps/discussionboard/do/forum?action=list_threads&course_id=_51767_1&nav=discussion_board_entry&conf_id=_214217_1&forum_id=_232476_1)

**Assessments** for the labs will consist of three short multi-choice
quizzes, one for each lab. They should only take 5 minutes, so just
complete them immediately after you have completed the lab\! The quizzes
will be on LMS.

The quiz deadlines are as follows:

Lab 1 assessment: Due 12pm 9th April Lab 2 assessment: Due 12pm 16th
April Lab 3 assessment: Due 12pm 30th April
