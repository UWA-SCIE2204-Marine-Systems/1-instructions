### Instructions for when in the Zoom meeting

We will potentially have 25 students logged in at once. To make things
manageable we need to follow a few guidelines:

1.  Unless you are speaking, please keep your **microphone muted**
    (click on the icon in the bottom left corner). You can have video on
    or off - it’s up to you.

2.  If you want to ask a question click on Participants in the centre
    and then click **raise hand**

3.  When I respond to your Raised hand I will say your name. Unmute your
    microphone and ask your question. Note than you will be able to hear
    everyone elses questions and my responses.

4.  You can also use the **chat** to ask questions. I will try and keep
    an eye on it, but I may miss your question. If I do just raise your
    hand.

5.  At some point I may ask you to share your screen . You can do this
    by clicking the share button in the bottom center of your Zoom
    window.

Zoom works best when you have a reasonable internet connection. It will
work on a mobile hostpot. If you do not have access to a reasonable
internet connection, and you need help with the exercises, you maybe
able access Unifi on campus.
